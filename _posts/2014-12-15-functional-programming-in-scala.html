<p>I've completed the Coursera course <a href="https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/">Functional Programming Principles in Scala</a>, with a <a href="https://coursera.org/verify/GVBCD4J8XX">Verified certificate</a>! Going through the course was a nice experience. It felt a-lot like the university years, including even finishing assignments at the last moment.. Even though I already experience on functional programming and some in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, I did learn quite a lot. The course was a refresher on functional programming, which I learned at the university. Also, some functional programming principles I knew how to apply in <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, now I know how to use them in Scala.</p>
