I've completed the Coursera course [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/), with a [Verified certificate](https://coursera.org/verify/GVBCD4J8XX)! Going through the course was a nice experience. It felt a-lot like the university years, including even finishing assignments at the last moment.. Even though I already experience on functional programming and some in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), I did learn quite a lot. The course was a refresher on functional programming, which I learned at the university. Also, some functional programming principles I knew how to apply in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), now I know how to use them in Scala.
