Two weeks ago I visited [Scala Days 2015](http://event.scaladays.org/scaladays-amsterdam-2015), in Amsterdam. The conference was great, with a lot of high level content.
Sessions I visited. I've attempted to order them by what I found most interesting, but the order certainly not conclusive. All sessions can be viewed online at [Parleys](https://www.parleys.com/channel/scala-days-amsterdam-2015):
