Via the newsletter of [Whitehorses](http://www.whitehorses.nl), the company I work for, an article written by me is published: [Gebruik de multi-core omgeving met Java 7 ](http://www.whitehorses.nl/whitebooks/2009/gebruik-de-multi-core-omgeving-met-java-7). As the title suggest, the article is in Dutch. The article explains some of the new features of Java 7 for creating software that runs in parallel on multiple cores.
