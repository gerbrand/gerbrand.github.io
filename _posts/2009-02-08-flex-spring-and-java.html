<p>Last year I worked with a collegue on a software project. As I architect I set up a backend. As frontend technology we used flex. As backend technology, we used Spring, JPA (via Toplink) and Java. Communication between frontend and backend was accomplished by using Blazeds.</p>
<p>The stack was very productive, and after a short learning curve, we could implement software quickly.</p>
<p>A nice and informative article on how to use these technologies is recently written by the collegue I worked with. The article is in Dutch, for those that can read that language see: <a href="http://www.whitehorses.nl/stack_attack%253A_flex%252C_spring%252C_jpa_en_toplink_2169.1195.html">Stack Attack: Flex, Spring, JPA en Toplink</a></p>
