<p>I wanted to setup a sample project that uses Flex and Scala. I followed the excellent tutorial on FlexOnRails: <a href="http://flexonrails.net/?p=103">Integrating Flex, BlazeDS, and Scala/Lift</a>. The tutorial helps a lot explaining how to set up your sample project. Unfortunately the tutorial is a bit outdated with regard to latest versions. Fortunately I could solve all problems! I'll list the problems I had. Also, I'll post my project. I won't redo the tutorial, as I certainly couldn't to a better job then Derek Wischusen.</p>
<ul>
<li>First problem I had, was getting my backend compiled. The liftweb has changed slightly, as a result the class Boot.scala didn't work anymore. I could solve it by downloading the latest <strong>Liftweb framework, version 0.9</strong>. I copied &amp; pasted the Boot.scala from the sites/examples dir. After a few tweaks (removing code I didn't need), the project compiled successfully!</li>
<li>Then I wanted to setup the flex project. That was quite easy, using the latest version of <strong>Flexbuilder (version 3.0.2.214193)</strong>.<br />
I setup flexbuilder to deploy in the backend/webapp directly, as is explained in the tutorial.</li>
<li>I ran the project by running the following maven commands in the backend subdir:<br />
<strong>mvn package</strong><br />
<strong>mvn jetty:run</strong></li>
<li>While running the example, I got a AbstractMethodError. I wasn't the first person to get that error, as I found on the <a href="http://markmail.org/message/sllcgvhebbp3nzbw#query:java.lang.AbstractMethodError%3A%20net.liftweb.http.SessionMaster%24.mailbox_%24eq(Lscala%2Factors%2FMessageQueue%3B)+page:1+mid:v5y2777ssl4mmqfq+state:results">Liftmailinglist</a>. I could fix the problem by using <strong>Scala version 2.7.1</strong> for my own project. All in all, when using bleeding-edge technologies, having the latest version isn't good always!</li>
<li>After that I ran the projectÂ  again. Now I get a NullPointerException, seems the line <em>val msgBroker = MessageBroker.getMessageBroker(null)</em> returns Null.<br />
Turned out I forgot to update the web.xml, the Flex servlet and other configuration has to be added.</li>
</ul>
<p>I named the sample project Elegante. Download the source here: <a href="https://www.functional-consulting.nl/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/elegante.zip">elegante.zip</a>. For explanation see the original tutorial.</p>
