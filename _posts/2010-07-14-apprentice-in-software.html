<p>When you want to become a pilot, you'll first have to be a co-pilot (after your training). You'll won't become a medical professional without working with an experienced doctor first. As software engineering is a profession that also combines deep knowledge, analytical skills and experience as well, why would this be any difference?</p>
<p>My company, Xebia, has started a master-apprentice program in the Netherlands. See <a href="http://www.xebia.com/apprenticeship">Apprenticeship Program</a> for more information.</p>
