Just read an article on electric cars in of the Saturday's edition of the [NRC](http://www.nrc.nl/) - a Dutch newspaper, which can be found online at the [authors blog (in Dutch)](http://weblogs.nrc.nl/luyendijk/2010/06/21/jeroen-pauw-als-rolmodel/). Some entrepreneur in electric cars is mentioned by the name of Alef Arendsen. The name did not immediately rang a bell, but when it was mentioned got his wealth after the sale of a opensource software company he co-founded I recalled. Alef Arendsen was part of [SpringSource](http://www.springsource.com/people/aarendsen), early on and made Spring big in the Netherlands (hm, I think I've read about the framework in about 2004 on javaworld, found it pretty cool - too bad I didn't do anything anything with it by then). He quit SpringSource about a year ago because he wanted to do something else.
He has now started a company in electric cars: [The  New Motion](http://www.thenewmotion.com/), which he mentions in his blog: [Challenges when introducing new technologies to the market](http://blog.arendsen.net/index.php/2010/06/09/challenges-when-introducing-new-technologies-to-the-market/). Quite a surprising move, but then again, you could say [Electric cars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car) are to traditional Petrol cars as Spring is to EJB2/J2EE.

(Above picture from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car) - of course electric cars aren't actually new, just as the idea dependency injection or reversion of control existed long before spring)
