I hadn't updated my homepage for quite a long time, having the idea to write a homepage. As a start I've upgraded from Jekyll 2 to Jekyll 3. I regenerated the page and copied plugins, settings and posts.  Not much seems to be broken. Even plugins I used are working. Since it's just a blog, I'll leave it as is. The welcome page contains a highlighter. I've rewritten (probably broken) the sample ruby code to javascript

{% highlight javascript %}
const print_hi = function(name) {console.log('Hi,', name)}
print_hi('world')
//=> prints 'Hi world' to console.
{% endhighlight %}
