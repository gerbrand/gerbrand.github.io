I've been on the Internet since 1997. I was also on [Fidonet](http://www.fidonet.org/) since 1995, until I got high speed internet (2Mbit shared) in 2000.

I keep all my passwords in a text document on a (hopefully) secure place and I just went to a few very old accounts to see if they're still active. Not surprisingly, of many of them even the domain-name doesn't work anymore:

I browsed to the first page of my saved passwords. Here are a few services for which I had an account, but that no longer work:



	
  * Ten - as a vaguely recall, a online gaming service. Ten.com no points to some porn site, so that's certainly not right.

	
  * Zone - also a gaming site. Could be that site has become [MSN Gaming zone](http://zone.msn.com/en-us/home), but there I can just login using my hotmail account.

	
  * Boo - some startup, no idea what they did.

	
  * mijn.wereld.nl - some sort of hyves, facebook, etc. in the early zero's. I knew one of the developers, I think he also worked for WorldOnline. Domain now points to something completely different.

	
  * Big Brother - a show that got quite popular.

	
  * filelibrary.com - Probably a site to download drivers. No longer active.

	
  * Napster - hopefully book publishers don't make the same mistake as the music industry did.

	
  * www.workspot.net - some sort of primitive Google Docs/ Dropbox as I recall.

	
  * nytimes.com - of course that site still exist, but my login isn't recognized anymore. Probably pointing to my university mail account.


Well these were some accounts a browsed to, fun enough. Fortunately, not all accounts registered in that time were idle: my slashdot account is still active and [Slashdot ](http://www.slashdot.org)is of course very much alive. Same for [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com). [ICQ](http://www.icq.com/) also still works, but I don't use that anymore. Actually, Slashdot I don't read regularly anymore either.
