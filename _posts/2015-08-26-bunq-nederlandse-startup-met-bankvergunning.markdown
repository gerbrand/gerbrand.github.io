[A Dutch start-up has a banking licence](http://www.dnb.nl/toezichtprofessioneel/de-consument-en-toezicht/registers/WFTDG/detail.jsp?id=c9dc52ce0358e311b55a005056b672cf): **[Bunq](https://www.bunq.com/nl/)**. According to their [blog](https://www.bunq.com/nl/blog) they use [Object-Oriented PHP as language](https://www.bunq.com/nl/blog/phava-by-bunq/) of choice, which get me more worried than excited. Nevertheless, quite cool that a startup is going to challenge the Dutch banking world. I am looking forward to what they accomplish.
