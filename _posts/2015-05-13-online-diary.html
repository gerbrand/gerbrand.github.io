<p>For quite a while I just to have digital personal diary. First as a text file stored in my computer, occasionally backed up on cd. Then I switched to <a href="http://ohlife.com/">ohlife.com</a>. I liked the clean interface and the fact that you'd get reminder mails you could just reply to create a new entry. Most of those reminders I just deleted I noticed. Ohlife shut down last year. Fortunately the creators allowed you to download a backup of all your entries so no content is lost.<br />
Since then I don't keep a personal diary. I do post occasionally on <a href="https://twitter.com/gerbrandvd">twitter</a> as well as lots of other social media or as it just to be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">word wide web</a>. My calendar is on <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar">google</a>, just as my mail and part of my documents. Besides that my photos and other documents are stored on my own laptop - not stored on any cloud (at least not that I know of), but synced via <a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthing</a> in case I lose my laptop. I create notes on <a href="https://evernote.com">evernote</a>, store articles I might want to read on <a href="https://getpocket.com">getpocket</a>, and sometimes publish code on <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a> or other hosted code services. And of course most of my activity is tracked by <a href="https://maps.google.com/locationhistory">Google</a>, Facebook and probably other organizations I know or not know of.<br />
<!--more--><br />
All in all a <strong>lot of digital data or information by or on me, created on purpose or by accident</strong>. All those information combined would be enough to reasonable 'auto-create' a diary entry.<br />
Some new online diaries I just found on the interweb allow integration with twitter and facebook such as <a href="https://journalate.com">Journalate</a>.  But I don't want to use on online diary anymore that stores data on it's own server(s), certainly not one that only allows you to download your entries if you pay <em>them</em> money. I'd rather have my diary stored on my own computer, or maybe on some <a href="https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/comment/4455/#Comment_4455">blockchain</a>, but only accessible by me. Also my hypothetical diary doesn't need to contain a copy of all that data, a link to that data combined with some tags or notes created by me would be could enough.</p>

<p>I wonder if something like that already exist?</p>
