By stumbled on a presentation by API lead of [Twitter ](http://twitter.com/)on [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). For a moment I hoped Twitter was developed, but the language used at Twitter is Ruby. The [speaker ](http://www.web2expo.com/webexsf2009/public/schedule/speaker/3485)investigated a few current-date programming languages and found Scala met his needs best. See [Why Scala](http://www.slideshare.net/al3x/why-scala-presentation).
