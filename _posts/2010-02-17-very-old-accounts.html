<p>I've been on the Internet since 1997. I was also on <a href="http://www.fidonet.org/">Fidonet</a> since 1995, until I got high speed internet (2Mbit shared) in 2000.</p>
<p>I keep all my passwords in a text document on a (hopefully) secure place and I just went to a few very old accounts to see if they're still active. Not surprisingly, of many of them even the domain-name doesn't work anymore:</p>
<p>I browsed to the first page of my saved passwords. Here are a few services for which I had an account, but that no longer work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ten - as a vaguely recall, a online gaming service. Ten.com no points to some porn site, so that's certainly not right.</li>
<li>Zone - also a gaming site. Could be that site has become <a href="http://zone.msn.com/en-us/home">MSN Gaming zone</a>, but there I can just login using my hotmail account.</li>
<li>Boo - some startup, no idea what they did.</li>
<li>mijn.wereld.nl - some sort of hyves, facebook, etc. in the early zero's. I knew one of the developers, I think he also worked for WorldOnline. Domain now points to something completely different.</li>
<li>Big Brother - a show that got quite popular.</li>
<li>filelibrary.com - Probably a site to download drivers. No longer active.</li>
<li>Napster - hopefully book publishers don't make the same mistake as the music industry did.</li>
<li>www.workspot.net - some sort of primitive Google Docs/ Dropbox as I recall.</li>
<li>nytimes.com - of course that site still exist, but my login isn't recognized anymore. Probably pointing to my university mail account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well these were some accounts a browsed to, fun enough. Fortunately, not all accounts registered in that time were idle: my slashdot account is still active and <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot </a>is of course very much alive. Same for <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>. <a href="http://www.icq.com/">ICQ</a> also still works, but I don't use that anymore. Actually, Slashdot I don't read regularly anymore either.</p>
