<p>Using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/Attribute/accesskey">accesskey</a> attribute, you can enable hotkeys for various html input elements. This allows one to get the focus to an input element by using the ALT-key + &lt;CHARACTER&gt; (on Windows) or CTRL-key + &lt;CHARACTER&gt; (on Mac). This way, your page is accessible by keyboards besides mouse.</p>
<p>Here's the example taken from the Mozilla DevCenter:</p>
<pre>  &lt;label value="Enter Name" accesskey="e" control="myName"/&gt;
  &lt;textbox id="myName"/&gt;
  &lt;button label="Cancel" accesskey="n"/&gt;
  &lt;button label="Ok" accesskey="O"/&gt;</pre>
<p>Both buttons as well as the input box can be accessed by ALT+E, ALT+N, ALT+O on Windows or CTRL+E, CTRL+N or CTRL+O on a Apple-Mac.</p>
<p>This is quite easy to program, and works for all popular browsers (including Internet Explorer, Safari or Firefox).<br />
There might be cases where you want to execute some javascript when an accesskey is hit, for example to fire a java-event. Almost all webapplications use javascript one way or another. Fortunately, you don't not complitated key-event-handling javascript to do that, just use an empty link:</p>
<pre>&lt;a href="#" accesskey="y" onclick="some javascript"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<p>The javascript is executed when the acesskey is hit, this case an ALT+y on Windows. The link is not displayed, so you're free wetter or not to display a button, link or anything within your web-application.</p>
