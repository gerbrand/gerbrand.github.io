From the newsletter of [TheServerSide.com](http://www.theserverside.com/) I received a whitepaper of [Instantiations](http://www.instantiations.com/rcpdeveloper/index.html), a GUI building tool. While I haven't read the entire paper yet, the introduction was quite intriguing;



<blockquote>
Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have evolved from command-line interfaces as user needs have changed. Today’s computer users require sophistication in an easy-to-use interface; most users have gotten very comfortable in a menu and mouse-driven world. Gen Xers, Gen Y’s and the Millennium generation who haven’t known a world without computers demand the total package—lightning-fast, feature-rich software with an intuitive, easy-to-use, visually attractive wrapper.</blockquote>



I am intrigued by the terms: Gen Xers, Gen Y’s and the Millennium generation. Apparently, these terms are now main-stream, even in the software sales industry.
