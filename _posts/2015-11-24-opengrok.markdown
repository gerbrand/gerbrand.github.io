Any organization that develops software has a lot of software around that could be potentially reused. Reusing software is of course a good thing. Serendipity, accidentally coming across useful code is a highly underestimated way for reusing software. To increase the change of software being reused like that is making all source-code searchable. So how do you make all the source-code in your organization searchable, just like [open-source](http://code.openhub.net) but without open-sourcing all your software? A few weeks ago I came across [OpenGrok](https://opengrok.github.io/OpenGrok/), a web-application that allows you to that: *making all your organization's code searchable*.
Installation was pretty easy. OpenGrok is a java-webapplication, packaged as a war-file (WebARchive), a standard way of packaging webapplications in Java. There's a script to install the webapplication in a few popular application servers, such as [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org).

I decided to install on Tomcat. Installation was almost a breeze. Only minor challenge was the deploy script wasn't yet ready for Tomcat 8, but that was [fixed easily](https://github.com/OpenGrok/OpenGrok/pull/1025).
After that I indexed some of my source-code I had developed over time, and my I could search my code! Using various query I could find various classes, types that were present in my code. Queries aren't as advanced as what sites like [OpenHub](http://code.openhub.net/search?s=cdef%3ASortUtils&pp=0&fl=Java&mp=1&ml=1&me=1&md=1&ff=1&filterChecked=true) offer, let alone what you can do in [Hoogle](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=Ord+a+%3d%3E+%5ba%5d+-%3E+%5ba%5d/). Nevertheless, it's better than having all your code locked up in source-repositories.

Steps to install were as follows. The steps are not extremely detailed, as am writing this a few weeks later. If you need more information, just add a comment below, or [contact me]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/):

*  First I downloaded the [latest release](https://github.com/OpenGrok/OpenGrok/releases) from OpenGrok at their Github site.
*  OpenGrok needs an applicaton server. I installed the one I knew best, Tomcat using Ubuntu's package manager:
```
apt-get install tomcat8
```
*  After that I shortly wondered how to get the opengrok-war deployed into tomcat until I noticed the deployment script in the distribution's directory could do that for me:
```
./Opengrok deploy
```
  Unfortunately tomcat8 wasn't supported yet, but as mentioned that was fixed easily. As my patch is already [merged](https://github.com/OpenGrok/OpenGrok/pull/1025) you won't have that problem.
*  The OpenGrok application is now running and I could access the application using http://localhost:8080/source. As expected no code is searchable yet because I did not tell OpenGrok what source-code to index yet.
*  Indexing my code could be done as follows:
```
OpenGrok index ~/workspace/GerbrandsMessyCode
```
*  I noticed some errors because some of the code I had was still using Subversion and some even in Cvs as source-control. That was fixable by just installing subversion and cvs using Ubuntu's package manager.
*  Reindexing, and even the history of my ancient code was included.
