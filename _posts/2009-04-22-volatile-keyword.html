<p>What does the volatile keyword in Java do? For years I thought the keyword was quite obsolete, synchronization of values between the memory multiple processors seemed quite exotic. Since even modern-day processors have multiple cores, the keyword has become more relevant. A few months ago I saw a good presentation by <a href="http://pveentjer.wordpress.com">Peter Veentjer</a> on NLJug, that you can see online <a href="http://www.xebia.com/sites/default/files/J-Spring%202009%20-%20Peter%20Veentjer.pdf">here</a>. I can recommend the presentation.<br />
Peter Veentjer also hinted about the Java Transaction Memory model. He was going to <a href="http://pveentjer.wordpress.com/2009/03/08/going-to-speak-on-nljug-j-spring-2009/">present </a>on this subject on JSpring. Unfortunately I couldn't attend the presentation myself, but I guess the presentation will be online soon as well.</p>
<p>While searching for more information (that I could copy&amp;paste) on the volatile keyword, I found the following excellent serie of articles on site called <a href="http://www.javamex.com/">JavaMex</a>: <a href="http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/synchronization_volatile.shtml">The volatile keyword in Java</a>. I hadn't heard of the site before, from what I have read so far, the site has some excellent content. Amazingly what fine information you can find online for free!</p>
