A while a go I used to do Swing development, and I sometimes used the tool of [Instantiations ](http://instantiations.com/)to develop my GUI. I quite liked the tool.
Before that I used Visual Basic and Visual Studio frequently. I never fully understood why people would fiddle so much with pixels, stylesheets, colors etc when you could just design your GUI visually.
Well, Instantiations has GWT design tool as well. I recently tried it out very shortly. The tool looked very nice.
I just recently Google bought Instantiations. Will this mean developer productivity in frontend development is cool again?
