Yesterday I've submitted a paper to [NLJUG](http://www.nljug.org/), the Dutch Java User Group for the [JFall 2009](http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2009/) conference. Together with colleagues we worked on a proposal for a very nice presentation on the [Google Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/). Like many programmers we were quite skeptical on yet-another [Dependency Injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control)/IC framework. We all know Spring, and dependency injection is now also part of the J2EE 1.5 / EJB3 standard. What makes Guice worth looking at?
In our talk we'll explain (of course) what Google Guice is, and how Guice compares to Spring and EJB3. Hope to see you on JFall!
