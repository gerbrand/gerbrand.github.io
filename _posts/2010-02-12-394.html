<p>From the newsletter of <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/">TheServerSide.com</a> I received a whitepaper of <a href="http://www.instantiations.com/rcpdeveloper/index.html">Instantiations</a>, a GUI building tool. While I haven't read the entire paper yet, the introduction was quite intriguing;</p>
<blockquote><p>
Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have evolved from command-line interfaces as user needs have changed. Today’s computer users require sophistication in an easy-to-use interface; most users have gotten very comfortable in a menu and mouse-driven world. Gen Xers, Gen Y’s and the Millennium generation who haven’t known a world without computers demand the total package—lightning-fast, feature-rich software with an intuitive, easy-to-use, visually attractive wrapper.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am intrigued by the terms: Gen Xers, Gen Y’s and the Millennium generation. Apparently, these terms are now main-stream, even in the software sales industry.</p>
