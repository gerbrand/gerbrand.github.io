<p>Just had evening of just trying out stuff and not finishing anything on my Windows machine.</p>
<p>I wanted to try out a persistence API for <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>. There's a JPA implementation for Cassandra: <a href="http://anismiles.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/kundera-knight-in-the-shining-armor/">Kundera</a>, as well as JDO implementation, on top (or using) datanucleus: <a href="http://github.com/PedroGomes/datanucleus-cassandra">datanucleus-cassandra</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Just to clarify why I would want such a thing: <strong>nosql </strong>solutions such as Cassandra are, in essence distributed key-value stores. I know, from following a few classes on databases and distributed databases when attending the university that's a whole lot more complicated to implement then it may seem.<br />
Nevertheless, to do anything useful with that you need a layer on top of the key-value store. Basically all SQL databases like Oracle or MySQL have SQL layer around there key-value store. But the nice thing about stuff like Cassandra you can put something more convenient on top.</p>
<p>I wanted to try out both, starting with the JDO version, as that seemed  more like a natural fit, and I once started ORM with JDO 1.0 many years  ago.<br />
I'd need a git client on Windows, and apparently there's already a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/">Tortoise Git client</a>, based on the truly great <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a>, on of the tools I really miss on my Mac. The client version of git first had to be installed, but that was quite easy as well, just download and install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">msysgit</a>.<br />
The tortoisegit client looks very well, and seems easy to use. At least I got the code of datanucleus-cassandra in a breeze. Well now it's kind of late, I'll try out later.</p>

<p>Other stuff I want to try out: creating a Rest service using <a href="http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.0/13-restlet/21-restlet.html">Restlet </a>on Google AppEngine. Just to find out how that works. But later.</p>
<p>Finally I saw a demo on <a href="http://www.vmforce.com/">VMForce</a>. Looks very promising, as I like Spring for development and that's what you'd use. Nothing is released however, now there's just articles and a demo.</p>
