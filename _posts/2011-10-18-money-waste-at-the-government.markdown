The (Dutch) website Computable has a [interesting article](http://www.computable.nl/artikel/ict_topics/overheid/4230545/1277202/rijk-verspeelt-doelbewust-5-miljard-euro-aan-ict.html) on how awful it is the government wastes enormous amounts of money on it-projects. With that regard a report by System Error on the UK government who are (were?) equally awful is still a good read: [Fixing the flaws in government IT](http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/23/)
