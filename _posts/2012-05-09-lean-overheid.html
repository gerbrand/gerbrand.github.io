<p>Quite a while, my top posting was about <a href="https://www.functional-consulting.nl/2011/10/money-waste-at-the-government/" title="Money waste at the government">waste at the government</a>.Â  Now something more positive on waste, and other lean subjects: I recently read the book '<a href="http://partner.bol.com/click/click?p=1&s=2396&t=p&sec=books-nl&pid=9200000001057519&f=PDL&name=leanoverheid">Een lean overheid</a>'. The book is in Dutch, and gives a nice introduction on using Lean in government organizations.<br />
Unlike other lean books, translated to Dutch or not, it's written specifically for the Dutch government. I guess most of this information is relevant for Dutch speaking readers, for those that speak English only: I am very fond of using lean at the government. Some people at the UK government seems to be getting it, as well as the US government. Hopefully the government in the Netherlands catches up soon!</p>
