Do you call yourself architect, while you're developing software or telling other people how to program? At least in the Netherlands, calling yourself Architect is illegal when you're not a officially registered architect:

Tip: 'professor' is not protected title. Call yourself professor while creating technical designs and choosing frameworks and you're fine.
