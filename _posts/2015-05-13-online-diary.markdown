For quite a while I just to have digital personal diary. First as a text file stored in my computer, occasionally backed up on cd. Then I switched to [ohlife.com](http://ohlife.com/). I liked the clean interface and the fact that you'd get reminder mails you could just reply to create a new entry. Most of those reminders I just deleted I noticed. Ohlife shut down last year. Fortunately the creators allowed you to download a backup of all your entries so no content is lost.
Since then I don't keep a personal diary. I do post occasionally on [twitter](https://twitter.com/gerbrandvd) as well as lots of other social media or as it just to be called [word wide web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). My calendar is on [google](https://www.google.com/calendar), just as my mail and part of my documents. Besides that my photos and other documents are stored on my own laptop - not stored on any cloud (at least not that I know of), but synced via [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) in case I lose my laptop. I create notes on [evernote](https://evernote.com), store articles I might want to read on [getpocket](https://getpocket.com), and sometimes publish code on [github](https://github.com/), [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or other hosted code services. And of course most of my activity is tracked by [Google](https://maps.google.com/locationhistory), Facebook and probably other organizations I know or not know of.
<!-- more -->
All in all a **lot of digital data or information by or on me, created on purpose or by accident**. All those information combined would be enough to reasonable 'auto-create' a diary entry.
Some new online diaries I just found on the interweb allow integration with twitter and facebook such as [Journalate](https://journalate.com).  But I don't want to use on online diary anymore that stores data on it's own server(s), certainly not one that only allows you to download your entries if you pay _them_ money. I'd rather have my diary stored on my own computer, or maybe on some [blockchain](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/comment/4455/#Comment_4455), but only accessible by me. Also my hypothetical diary doesn't need to contain a copy of all that data, a link to that data combined with some tags or notes created by me would be could enough.

I wonder if something like that already exist?
