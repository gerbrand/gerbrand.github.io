<p>Yesterday I've submitted a paper to <a href="http://www.nljug.org/">NLJUG</a>, the Dutch Java User Group for the <a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2009/">JFall 2009</a> conference. Together with colleagues we worked on a proposal for a very nice presentation on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Google Guice</a>. Like many programmers we were quite skeptical on yet-another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">Dependency Injection</a>/IC framework. We all know Spring, and dependency injection is now also part of the J2EE 1.5 / EJB3 standard. What makes Guice worth looking at?<br />
In our talk we'll explain (of course) what Google Guice is, and how Guice compares to Spring and EJB3. Hope to see you on JFall!</p>
