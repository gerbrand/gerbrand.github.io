<p>Today I working on a application that uses the <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/">Wicket framework</a>. I was plagued with the following Exception:</p>
<pre>WicketMessage: org.apache.wicket.WicketRuntimeException: component myForm:myTable:editor not found on page nl.gerbrand-ict.gui.HomePage[id = 4], listener interface = [RequestListenerInterface name=IActivePageBehaviorListener, method=public abstract void org.apache.wicket.behavior.IBehaviorListener.onRequest()]

Root cause:

...</pre>
<p>In place of the ... there was a full stacktrace, which information that's not not relevant for this posting.</p>
<p>Turned out the solution was pretty simple, but the cause isn't that easy to find and is quite a good example how some design decisions in Wicket aren't considered as clean.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I'm using Ajax-features of Wicket extensively.<br />
I was creating a table, which contained editable fields (AjaxEdiableLabel). This would allow the user to click on a field in the table, to edit the content.<br />
Somewhere I had the following code:</p>
<pre>target.addComponent(item);
if .. needed .. {
target.addComponent(myTable.this);
... make item invisible
}
super.onSubmit(target);</pre>
<p>The super.onSubmit belonged, in this case, to AjaxEditableLabel. I found out the super.onSubmit() would call <em>target.addComponent(this);</em> to update the editable label itself. As you could see, in my code I'm telling wicket to update the component that's the parent of the editable label also.</p>
<p>In this case, the code caused wicket to first update the parent-panel, which in this case makes the child-component invisible. Then the wicket tries to redraw the child-component, which is then invisible. That will trigger the above error.<br />
Unfortunately, solving this error isn't quite easy in all cases. Especially when you'd use a AjaxSelfUpdatingBehaviour you can have little control on the redrawing order.</p>
<p>Fortunately I found <a href="http://apache-wicket.1842946.n4.nabble.com/WicketRuntimeException-component-not-found-on-page-td3055902.html">a good tip on the wicket mailing list</a> to get rid of the exception. Add the following code your Wicketapplication class (the class that extends org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WebApplication):</p>
<pre>    @Override
    protected IRequestCycleProcessor newRequestCycleProcessor() {
    	//Tip from http://apache-wicket.1842946.n4.nabble.com/WicketRuntimeException-component-not-found-on-page-td3055902.html
    	return new WebRequestCycleProcessor(){
    		public IRequestTarget resolve(final RequestCycle requestCycle,
    				final RequestParameters requestParameters) {
    	        try {
    	            return super.resolve(requestCycle, requestParameters);
    	        } catch (InvalidUrlException e) {
    	            if (requestCycle.getRequest().getURL().contains("LinkListener") || requestCycle.getRequest().getURL().contains("BehaviorListener")) {
    	            	log.warn("Couldn't process event, is ignored because of: "+e.getMessage());
                        //ignore exception
    	                return new PageRequestTarget(requestCycle.getRequest().getPage());
    	            } else {
                        //normal operation
    	            	throw e;
    	            }
    	        }
    	    }

    	};
    }</pre>
<p>The above code will ignore all of the exception that occur when wicket tries to do something with an component that's no longer available because of an ajax-update. Of course this fix isn't very nice, hopefully later versions of Wicket fix the error all-together when Ajax-support is improved. For now, this seems the best solution.</p>
