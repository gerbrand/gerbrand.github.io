<p>I often view or read the InfoQ, a site with articles on software development, programming. Almost all content they publish is very good. One I just saw was: <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/tim-bray-future-of-web">Tim Bray on the Future of the web</a>, an interview with someone of Sun. Interesting view has Tim on the web. He's quite sceptical on RIA. Many ordinary users we're quite glad when webapplications came - as they replaces often hard to use applications created using Visual Basic, VC++, Delphi and others with pull-down menu's, ill-designs user interfaces. He also considers a bad thing if the back-button is disabled, many users find very relieving if they can go back once they're confused. Gives you something to think about.<br />
I don't agree for entirely - they're a lot of very good applications too, and there are quite confusing webapplications. But still, maybe for many applications he's right.</p>
