I am subscribed to several technology related newsletters, including those of [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com). Very often these newsletters feature very interesting content. Unfortunately, a increasingly large portion of those newsletters now includes broadcasts of presentations. With the emerge of Youtube, broadband and Al Gore's movie [An Inconvenient Truth](http://www.moviemeter.nl/film/36759/), the trend is that information on the Internet should be in movies or sound.
That's quite unfortunate for me. I often prefer to read something, rather then listening and watching something, at least to get information. Also, all too often I'm reading those newsletters in the occasion I can't bother other people with sound. Well, could use a headphone - but I don't have any ;-).

I wonder if other people have that problem too?
