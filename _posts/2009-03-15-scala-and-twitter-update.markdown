Recently wrote about a presentation on the interesest in Scala of tech-lead at Twitter. On another site a Twitter developer[ wrote half a year ago](http://www.gracelessfailures.com/2008/06/test-post.html) that several people at his company are learning Scala.  On the Twitter dev site I found a [client-application](http://github.com/dcbriccetti/scala-experiments/tree/master) for Twitter written in Scala.  [The application](http://davebsoft.com/applications/simple-twitter-client) looks simple, but I make to little use of Twitter to know how good it compares. According to another article I found via Google, [part of Twitter is (re)implemented in Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1008)!
