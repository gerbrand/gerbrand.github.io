<p>Recently wrote about a presentation on the interesest in Scala of tech-lead at Twitter. On another site a Twitter developer<a href="http://www.gracelessfailures.com/2008/06/test-post.html"> wrote half a year ago</a> that several people at his company are learning Scala.  On the Twitter dev site I found a <a href="http://github.com/dcbriccetti/scala-experiments/tree/master">client-application</a> for Twitter written in Scala.  <a href="http://davebsoft.com/applications/simple-twitter-client">The application</a> looks simple, but I make to little use of Twitter to know how good it compares. According to another article I found via Google, <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1008">part of Twitter is (re)implemented in Scala</a>!</p>
