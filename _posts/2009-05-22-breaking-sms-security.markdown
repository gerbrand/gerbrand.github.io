I wrote some time ago about [false sense of security](/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&post=121) in many secure applications such as internet-banking. Now one of the predictions I made have become reality, as you can read on this (Dutch) article on webwereld: [Onderzoekers kapen tan-code met Nokia 1100](http://webwereld.nl/nieuws/58572/onderzoekers-kapen-tan-code-met-nokia-1100.html).
Using a hacked mobile phone, a security company could intercept a TAN-code that is used to authorize payments and money-transfers using internet-banking. Although there is no reported use of this hack, researchers did notice second-hand mobile phones did increase a lot in value.
