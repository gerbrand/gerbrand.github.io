<p>Just read an article on electric cars in of the Saturday's edition of the <a href="http://www.nrc.nl/">NRC</a> - a Dutch newspaper, which can be found online at the <a href="http://weblogs.nrc.nl/luyendijk/2010/06/21/jeroen-pauw-als-rolmodel/">authors blog (in Dutch)</a>. Some entrepreneur in electric cars is mentioned by the name of Alef Arendsen. The name did not immediately rang a bell, but when it was mentioned got his wealth after the sale of a opensource software company he co-founded I recalled. Alef Arendsen was part of <a href="http://www.springsource.com/people/aarendsen">SpringSource</a>, early on and made Spring big in the Netherlands (hm, I think I've read about the framework in about 2004 on javaworld, found it pretty cool - too bad I didn't do anything anything with it by then). He quit SpringSource about a year ago because he wanted to do something else.<br />
He has now started a company in electric cars: <a onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.thenewmotion.com?referer=http://www.springsource.com/people/aarendsen');" href="http://www.thenewmotion.com/">The  New Motion</a>, which he mentions in his blog: <a href="http://blog.arendsen.net/index.php/2010/06/09/challenges-when-introducing-new-technologies-to-the-market/">Challenges when introducing new technologies to the market</a>. Quite a surprising move, but then again, you could say <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car">Electric cars</a> are to traditional Petrol cars as Spring is to EJB2/J2EE.</p>

<p>(Above picture from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car">Wikipedia</a> - of course electric cars aren't actually new, just as the idea dependency injection or reversion of control existed long before spring)</p>
