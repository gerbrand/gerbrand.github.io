A few months ago I got a twitter ad for a service that would you help deploying mobile applications to each platforms store, market or portal. Having some experience on the minor hassle to get anything on the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store) or [Appstore](https://itunes.apple.com), ship.io seems to be a valuable service. So I signed up.
This morning I received a surprising mail ship.io is [shutting down](https://ship.io/ship-io-is-shutting-down/).

 I didn't have the time yet to try out the service, having no mobile apps I needed to deliver. You could say that I was lucky not to use their service yet, but on the other hand, creating build-scripts to deliver apps isn't that hard, considering that you need to create build-scripts anyway. Maybe that was ship.io's problem. The value they could deliver wasn't as high as it seems at first sight. But as said, I didn't had time yet to try them out, and now that's too late.
