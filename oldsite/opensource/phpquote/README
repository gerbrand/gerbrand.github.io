The PHPQuote_com can be used to retrieve quotes from the finance site: Quote.com.
Although Yahoo is faster and more convenient to retrieve data from, Quote.com might feature symbols or information you can't find on Yahoo.

The script is based on PHPQuote from BooyahMedia.com, see: http://www.booyahmedia.com/open-source/phpquote/

The licence of the script PHPQuote_com is, like PHPQuote, GNU-GPL.
