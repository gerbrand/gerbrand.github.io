I am Gerbrand van Dieijen, father, programmer, rower, reader, citizen of the European Union with a broad interest in all aspects of software-engineering. On this weblog I'll post thoughts, opinions, analyses on trends and tutorials on IT-related subjects.

I work as freelance consultant. I'm specialized in software development and architecture, mainly using, but not limited to, languages on Java Virtual Machine.

Do know more about what I've done, you can check out my [LinkedIn-profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/gerbrand). I've also got some [code on GitHub](https://github.com/gerbrand/). Last but not least [Google](http://www.google.nl/search?q=gerbrand+van+dieijen)Â returns quite some hits.
