OpenID is gaining popularity!Â  Hyves is now also OpenId-provider, as published on the (Dutch) site [Webwereld](http://webwereld.nl/nieuws/56963/hyves-ondersteunt-nu-ook-openid.html). This means you can use your hyve account to login to any site that provides OpenId. Saves remembering passwords. Unfortunatelly, you can't login to Hyves using another OpenId - Hyves is not a OpenId consumer. If Hyves would be an OpenId consumer you could login using for example your Hotmail account or Gmail account.
