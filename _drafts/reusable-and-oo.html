<p>In the resource UML was mentioned. So my guess is CBD is actually about object oriented design. Design your software as classes each having methods and properties. Group them in components based on functionality.<br />
Glue components together to get new software fast.</p>
<p>This idea is already relatively old. Unfortunately most of the time, at least OO, doesn't help in re-usability. A UML design is created, software is coded but in the end a lot of code is produced that's hard to maintain and certainly not reusable.<br />
We re-use frameworks, but we need a lot of boiler code just to get anything done. Every few months a new frameworks comes up that promises to minimize boiler plate code.</p>
