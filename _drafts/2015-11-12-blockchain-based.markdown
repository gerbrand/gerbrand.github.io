A lot of innovative products on top of Bitcoin, or use another Blockchain-based technology. Some I heard about recently:
* [Factom](http://factom.org/) Allows Bitcoin to work as a notary's register: proving that a certain document or file existed at an exact moment, with an exact content. Factom stores a checksum of the document on a side-blockchain, that's synced with Bitcoin. Without going into details, means the actual document is not stored at the blockchain. The document can be stored anywhere, like your own homepage. Using factom you can prove to anyone the document isn't altered *and* existed at a certain moment.
*  [Counterparty](http://counterparty.io/). Do you want to create your own coin? Or issue shares or other kind of securities for your company, association, trust, foundation, e.g.? Or do you want to buy something like a 3d-printer with multiple people, sharing the costs? Then you'll at least need a registry of who ones what share for what valuation. Many organizations trust their accountant or treasurer to maintain something like an Excel-document with the overview of shares, but that's pretty expensive and/or cumbersome. Also you'll have to trust that person in maintaining your registry properly.
[Counterparty](http://counterparty.io/why-counterparty/) solves this! You can issue any security, bond, coin, coupon using Counterparty to replace your shared Excel. So you'll have all the power of a stock-exchange, but with very low costs. Just like Factrom, Counterparty uses Bitcoin as it's infrastructure.
* [Ethereum](http://www.ethereum.com)
