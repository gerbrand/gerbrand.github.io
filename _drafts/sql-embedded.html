<p>In a previous post I wrote about modern DBMS having the capability to execute queries in parallel. Besides that kind of optimization, a DBMS also other kinds of optimizations that can be performed. When using ORM -frameworks, a developer loses a lot of these optimalisations. ORM frameworks often send SQL to the database to retrieve a lot more data then the programmer actually wants.<br />
Also, many times SQL is a lot more flexible and expressive in retrieving data then a ORM is.</p>
<p>Unfortunatelly, many programmers view the database as something 'ugly' they want to get as far as possible from. Java programmers use ORM software like JDO or Hibernate, or write a lot of *Dao classes to 'hide' the database.<br />
On the other hand many DBA'ers or people responsible for the databaseschema involve them self with the software development process as little as possible. They create the database, a few stored procedures and leave it up to the developers to use them.</p>
<p>The development of data (base) centered sofware, and most software is, would benefit a lot for a much more tighter integration between these two worlds: Java and SQL.</p>
<p>Some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQLJ http://tinman.cs.gsu.edu/~raj/books/Oracle9-chapter-6.pdf</li>
<li>IBatis</li>
</ul>
<p>To allow your software to take advantage of the capabilities of DBMS, is limiting the number of operations done by the application-software.<br />
<strong>Let the database do the work</strong><br />
In short: do less in application-server and do more in the database. With the latter I do not mean using PLSQL more instead of Java. Allowing the database to do more, means sending more complicated SQL-queries to the database, that can keep the database more busy and thus allow the database to do more optimizations.<br />
Unfortunately often used technologies as ORM frameworks result in exactly the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>TODO IBatis 3, annotations</strong></p>
