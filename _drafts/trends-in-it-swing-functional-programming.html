<p>What is important for the coming future, with regard to IT? For the coming year Swing is becoming more important and main-stream again. RAD-Swing tools have improved a lot - like for example Netbeans Swing GUI Builder. The swing-framework will improve with addition of JSR 296 - at the same time Swing is very similar to a few years ago. Programmer's who are fed up</p>
