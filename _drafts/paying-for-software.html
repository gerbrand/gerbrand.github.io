<p>I recently used ITunes for the first time on my current Mac laptop, and as result a I came accross the TuneUp store. TuneUp is software to find duplicate tracks, fix track names and find the correct information for mp3 files with names such as 'Track 01.mp3'. All in all quite usuful, allthough my paid Winamp can already do the same, I downloaded the trial. That's where I wanted to blog about: TuneUp, as well as several other software and web-applications such as Wordpress now offer free but limited accounts and paid accounts. I really like that trend: rather then relying on something vague as advertisements, those companies at least for a part on paid subscriptions.</p>
