<p>In the (Dutch) newsÂ  paper I read, NRC, an column by Erica Verdegaal on saving (tax) money by exchanging goods rather then selling new stuff and loaning stuff to friends rather then from banks.<br />
Via mywheels.nl, snappcar.nl and toogethr.com and wego,.nu you can lend out your car. Via connectcar.nl and greenwheels.nl and studentcar.nl you can borrow a car very easy and flexible. To rent your cars to family or friends there's a example loan agreement on autodate.nl Sharing stuff can be via spullendelen.nl. Swapping clothes via kledingruilfeest and kleding ruilen (?). Ruilkringen.</p>
<p>Flexible daycare via buurtoudersnederland.nl</p>
