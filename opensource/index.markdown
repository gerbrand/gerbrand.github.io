## Open source
I've created quite some software in the last 15 years, some of which is open-source. Some of that software is on [Github](https://github.com/gerbrand/). Code is written in Scala, Java, Javascript or Python.

Lately I mainly used [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org) and I'm quite fond of this programming language. I've done quite a lot with [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) software, using [Embark](https://github.com/iurimatias/embark-framework) and [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth).
