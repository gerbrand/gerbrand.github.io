## Open source
I've created quite some software in the last 15 years, some of which is open-source. Some of that software is on [Github](https://github.com/gerbrand/). Most code is written in Java, some in Scala, Javascript or Python.

## The past

Here are some very old projects written in languages I wouldn't use now. Since even the out-dated software is listed in some search results, I'll list that here too.

  * [PHPLycosquote ](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freshmeat_phplycosquote/)- A adapted PHPQuote, to retrieve quotes from the Lycos site instead of Yahoo. Basically a web-scraping tool.Â  Software no longer functions as the site has changed. With some modifications you should get it to work.

  * [PHPMyNewsletter ](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freshmeat_phpmynewsletter/)- I've adapted the version for the site [www.instruct.nl](http://www.instruct.nl/sf35/sf.mcgi?ac=deeplink&id=46) a few years ago. The modifications I submitted in CVS, but I don't know if these were released by the author.

  * Overhoor - An DOS-program I created as teen-ager in Basic. The software and source code should be somewhere on my computer - but for now there are nicer alternatives
