No cookie is stored when you visit this homepage. Nevertheless, I'd recommend using a webbrowser that respects your privacy such as [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) or [Brave](https://www.brave.com/).

When you visit this homepage, your ip-address will be logged, but no other information that could be linked to personal. Also if you’d use VPN, [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), or other similar software no attempt is made to reveal your true ip-address.

My homepage is hosted at [Transip](https://www.transip.nl), a Dutch provider. I pay them, which mean I am their customer and not the other way around. They don’t earn any money on advertising on my homepage.
